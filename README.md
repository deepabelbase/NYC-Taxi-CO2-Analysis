NYC Taxi CO2 Emissions Analysis
This project analyzes the environmental impact of taxi rides in New York City using trip data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The analysis focuses on estimating the total carbon emissions generated by taxis and identifying trends based on trip distance, trip duration, and passenger count.

Project Description
Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to estimate CO2 emissions produced by NYC taxis for a selected time period and provide insights into how these emissions are affected by trip characteristics such as distance and passenger count.

Data
The dataset used for this analysis includes taxi trip records in Parquet format from June 2018. Each record provides detailed information about the trip, including the number of passengers, trip distance, pickup and dropoff timestamps, fare, and more.

Calculations
CO2 emissions for each trip were calculated using the following formula:

Fuel Consumed (in gallons) = Distance Traveled (in miles) / 22 miles per gallon
CO2 Emissions (in kg) = Fuel Consumed (gallons) * 8.89 kg CO2 per gallon
Visualizations
The project provides a line plot showing the Total CO2 Emissions per Day for two groups:
1-2 Passengers
3+ Passengers
Key Results
Estimated CO2 Emissions: Calculated CO2 emissions for each trip in the dataset using Python and Databricks.
Emissions Trends: The analysis shows that rides with more passengers tend to produce slightly higher emissions overall, though single-passenger rides are more frequent.
Recommendations to Reduce Emissions:
Encourage shared rides (more passengers per trip)
Promote fuel-efficient taxi vehicles such as hybrid or electric models
Implement pricing incentives for shorter, eco-friendly trips.
Tools and Technologies
Python for data processing and emissions calculations
Apache Spark (PySpark) on Databricks for handling large datasets and performing calculations
Matplotlib for visualizing the results
